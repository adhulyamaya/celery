## Celery & Task Scheduling in Django  ðŸš€

## Introduction

Celery is an asynchronous task queue that helps Django applications handle background tasks efficiently. It allows you to run long-running or scheduled tasks without blocking the main application.

## Why Use Celery?

âœ… Background Task Processing

Offload time-consuming tasks (e.g., sending notifications, processing files) from the main app.

Prevent slow response times by running tasks in the background.

âœ… Periodic Task Scheduling

Run scheduled tasks like database cleanup, backups, and notification reminders.

Use django-celery-beat to manage periodic tasks from the Django Admin panel.

## Components

1. Celery

The core task queue framework that allows Django to run asynchronous jobs.

2. Redis (Message Broker)

Acts as a middleman between Django and Celery, queuing tasks until they are processed.

Alternative: RabbitMQ (for more reliability, but harder to set up).

3. Celery Workers

The background processes that execute Celery tasks.

4. Django-Celery-Beat (For Scheduling Tasks)

Enables Django Admin integration to create and manage periodic tasks.

5. Django-Celery-Results (For Tracking Task Execution)

Stores task results in the database for monitoring and debugging.

## Installation

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install celery redis django-celery-beat django-celery-results
```

## Configuration

1. Set Up Celery in Django

 Inside Django project, create a celery.py file next to settings.py:

```bash
import os
from celery import Celery

os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'your_project.settings')

app = Celery('your_project')
app.config_from_object('django.conf:settings', namespace='CELERY')
app.autodiscover_tasks()

Add Celery settings to settings.py:

CELERY_BROKER_URL = 'redis://localhost:6379/0'
CELERY_ACCEPT_CONTENT = ['json']
CELERY_TASK_SERIALIZER = 'json'

```

2. Define a Celery Task

Inside  Django app  create a tasks.py file:

```bash
from celery import shared_task

@shared_task
def send_admin_notification(message):
    print(f'Admin Notification: {message}')
```

3. Running Celery Worker

Start the Redis server:
```bash
redis-server
```
Run the Celery worker:
```bash
celery -A your_project worker --loglevel=info

Scheduling Periodic Tasks (Using django-celery-beat)
```

1. Apply Migrations
```bash
python manage.py migrate django_celery_beat
```

2. Add Celery Beat to Installed Apps
```bash
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'django_celery_beat',
]
```
3. Start Celery Beat Service
```bash

celery -A your_project beat --loglevel=info
```

4. Create a Periodic Task

Go to Django Admin â†’ Periodic Tasks â†’ Add a new periodic task.

Example: Notification Before Expiry Date

Assume we have a Policy model with expiry_date. We need to notify admins 3 days before a policy expires.

```bash
tasks.py:

from datetime import timedelta
from django.utils import timezone
from celery import shared_task
from your_app.models import Policy

@shared_task
def notify_admin_about_expiring_policies():
    three_days_from_now = timezone.now() + timedelta(days=3)
    expiring_policies = Policy.objects.filter(expiry_date__lte=three_days_from_now)
    for policy in expiring_policies:
        print(f'Policy {policy.name} is expiring soon!')
```

Schedule this task to run daily using django-celery-beat.

## Running Everything Together

Start Redis:
```bash
redis-server
```
Run Celery Worker:
```bash
celery -A your_project worker --loglevel=info
```
Run Celery Beat:
```bash
celery -A your_project beat --loglevel=info
```
Django Server :
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Now, Celery will run background tasks, and periodic tasks will execute based on schedule
